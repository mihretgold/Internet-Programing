      Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language and file format for
      storing, transmitting, and reconstructing arbitrary data. It defines a set
      of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable
      and machine-readable. The World Wide Web Consortium's XML 1.0
      Specification of 1998 and several other related specifications—all of them
      free open standards—define XML. The design goals of XML emphasize
      simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. It is a textual
      data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages.
      Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely
      used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those
      used in web services.
