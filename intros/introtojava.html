    <p>
      Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented wprogramming language
      that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
      <br />It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let
      programmers write once,<br />
      run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all
      platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.<br />
      Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any
      Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer
      architecture.
      <br />
      The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level
      facilities than either of them. <br />
      The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and
      runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional
      compiled languages.
