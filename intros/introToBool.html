      Boolean Logic is a form of algebra that is centered around three simple
      words known as Boolean Operators: “Or,” “And,” and “Not.” These Boolean
      operators are the logical conjunctions between your keywords in a search
      to help broaden or narrow its scope. At the heart of a Boolean Logic
      expression is the idea that all values are either true or false. In other
      words, Boolean means using operators to compare variables against the
      criteria you define to determine if the variables meet them. A Boolean
      operation, then, is the construction of a logical expression to help carry
      out that function.
