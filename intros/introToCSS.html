      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
      the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML
      or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a
      cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
      JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and
      presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can
      improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
      specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages
      to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
      file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content;
      and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed
      between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
