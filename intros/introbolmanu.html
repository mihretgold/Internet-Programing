      This is an approach where you can transform one boolean expression into an
      equivalent expression by applying Boolean Theorems. Minimising terms and
      expressions can be important because electrical circuits consist of
      individual components that are implemented for each term or literal for a
      given expression. This allows designers to make use of fewer components,
      thus reducing the cost of a particular system. It should be noted that
      there are no fixed rules that can be used to minimise a given expression.
      It is left to an individuals ability to apply Boolean Theorems in order to
      minimise a function.
