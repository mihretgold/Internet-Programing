      Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by
      Adobe Inc. for Windows and macOS. It was originally created in 1987 by
      Thomas and John Knoll. Since then, the software has become the most used
      tool for professional digital art, especially in raster graphics editing.
