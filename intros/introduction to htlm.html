    <p>
      At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements,<br />
      which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a
      document <br />(Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a
      table?),<br />
      structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header?<br />
      Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as
      <br />
      images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of
      these and <br />
      introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand
      HTML.
