      In computing, a database is an organized collection of data stored and
      accessed electronically. Small databases can be stored on a file system,
      while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage.
      The design of databases spans formal techniques and practical
      considerations, including data modeling, efficient data representation and
      storage, query languages, security and privacy of sensitive data, and
      distributed computing issues, including supporting concurrent access and
      fault tolerance.
